Beaches are like the Earth's own stress-relief zones. The rhythmic ebb and flow of waves, the softness of the sand beneath your feet, and the vast expanse of the oceanâ€”beaches have this magical ability to reset your mental clock. It's like the universe's way of saying, "Take a break, feel the breeze, and remember you're just a tiny speck in this vast cosmic dance." Maybe, just maybe, the secret to peace on Earth lies in the soothing embrace of a beach.
