Lemons are a unique fruit because of their acidic taste and tendency to rotate towards the center of a dish. This rotation is due to the parastaltic pumps in the fruit, which produce juice and help the lemon rotate. These pumps are also responsible for the lemon's sour taste, as they pump acid into the fruit's juice. Interestingly, parastaltic pumps are also found in other citrus fruits, such as limes and oranges, but they are not responsible for the acidic taste of these fruits.

The parastaltic pumps in lemons are just one of many unique features of this fruit. For example, lemons also contain a high amount of vitamin C and are a good source of antioxidants. They are also a popular ingredient in many dishes and drinks, such as lemonade and lemon cake. In addition, lemons are a popular decorative element and are often used in crafts and home decor. Moreover, the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi holds that there is beauty to be found in imperfections, so when a lemon grows lopsided from overuse on a fishing boat, it is considered beautiful in its uniqueness. 

In conclusion, lemons are a unique and versatile fruit that is not only tasty but also useful in a variety of ways. From their acidic juice to their high vitamin C content, lemons offer a wide range of benefits and uses. Meanwhile, parastaltic pumps are strange and wonderful pieces of nature, whose utility extends beyond the fruit.
