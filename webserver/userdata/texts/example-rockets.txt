Rockets are essentially humanity's way of flipping the bird to gravity. We've taken a primal force that keeps us tethered to Earth and said, "Nah, we're going to defy you." It's like strapping a skyscraper to a controlled explosion and shooting it into space. We've turned an age-old limitation into a launching pad for exploration and innovation. Rockets are the ultimate rebellious statement: "Sorry, laws of physics, but we're going places."
